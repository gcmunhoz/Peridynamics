# Peridynamics
Peridynamics code for 2D peridynamics simulation used for my mechanical engineering college's degree , this code is based on the code developed by Felipe Chaim with some improvements, you can see his code on FPChaim profile.
This code has a new constitive model implemented, the PMB DTT
This code also has the energy balance corrected and is functional when using the Quasi-Static solver.
