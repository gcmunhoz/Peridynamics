# Peridynamics
Peridynamics code for 2D peridynamics simulation used for my mechanical engineering college's degree, it can be accessed in https://repositorio.unesp.br/handle/11449/244240. This code is based on the code developed by Felipe Chaim with some improvements, you can see his code on FPChaim profile or https://github.com/FPChaim/peridynamics.git.

This code has a new constitive model implemented, the PMB DTT

This code also has the energy balance corrected and is functional when using the Quasi-Static solver.

#The code is not complete and may have some bugs or errors
